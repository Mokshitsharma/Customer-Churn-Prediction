# üìâ Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## üß† Predicting Customer Retention with AI-Driven Insights
This project implements an end-to-end customer churn forecasting system using machine learning techniques to identify which customers are most likely to leave a telecom service provider. It demonstrates the entire data science workflow‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model evaluation and insight generation.

## üí° Project Overview

### üéØ Objective
Detect customers likely to discontinue their service and identify the key factors contributing to churn.

### üîç Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Telco Customer Churn  
- **Source:** Kaggle (blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
- **Rows:** 7,043  
- **Features:** 21 (Demographics, Contract Type, Charges, etc.)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Technologies
- **Programming & Visualization:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Dataset Download:** KaggleHub

## üß© Steps Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing and invalid entries in `TotalCharges`  
- Converted categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding  
- Scaled numeric columns using `StandardScaler`  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized churn distribution and customer demographics  
- Identified churn patterns by contract type, service, and tenure  
- Correlation analysis between monthly/total charges and churn rate  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
Three baseline models were trained and compared:

| Model               | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | Remark                                      |
|--------------------|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 80.7%   | 84.1%   | Best balance between performance & interpretability |
| Random Forest       | 78.9%   | 82.6%   | Strong performance, higher complexity     |
| XGBoost             | 78.5%   | 83.1%   | Optimized boosting model, consistent accuracy |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Insights
- Month-to-month contracts show higher churn probability  
- Short-tenure customers are more likely to switch providers  
- High charges correlate with increased churn  
- Customers lacking Online Security or Tech Support churn significantly more  

---

## üìä Key Results
- Logistic Regression achieved **81% accuracy** and **84% ROC-AUC**  
- Classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves were plotted  
- Generated actionable business insights for customer retention
